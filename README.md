As a security analyst, I protect an organization's digital assets and information systems from threats and vulnerabilities. I assess security risks, implement protective measures, monitor for potential breaches, and respond to incidents when they occur. My work involves analyzing security data, staying up-to-date with the latest cyber threats and defense techniques, and collaborating with teams across the organization to maintain a strong security posture. I'm passionate about safeguarding sensitive information and helping to create a more secure digital environment.


## OBJECTIVE

This objective emphasizes:

Implementation of a structured program
A systematic approach to handling vulnerabilities
Coverage of the entire IT infrastructure
Risk reduction
Overall improvement in cybersecurity
